Lakkundi has about 50 temples and temple ruins of different sizes and sophistication, all dated to pre-14th century. They are of Shaivism, Jainism and Vaishnavism,
though most temples include diverse iconography such as Surya and of Vedic deities such as Brahma.For example, the oldest Jaina temple – Brahma Jinalaya – includes
 Hindu statues and artworks such as that of 4-headed Brahma, Saraswati and Lakshmi, along with Mahavira, Parsvanatha and other Tirthankaras.

a)brahma jinalaya:

The Brahma Jinalaya, sometimes called as the Greater Jain Temple of Lakkundi, is an early 11th-century Mahavira temple in Lakkundi, Gadag District of Karnataka state,
 India. The temple is attributed to Attiyabbe (Danacintamani Attimbbe), the wife of the local governor Dandanayaka Nagadeva. It faces east, has a mukhamandapa, a
gudhamandapa and its sanctum is covered by a sur-temple style vimana superstructure. The temple is notable for its reliefs depicting Jaina artwork, statues of the 
Tirthankaras and the two Hindu statues of Brahma and Saraswati inside its inner mandapa.[1][2]

The temple was ruined and mutilated during or after the wars of the 13th-century.[clarification needed] It was rediscovered by British archaeologists led by Henry 
Cousens in "deserted, filthy condition, occupied by a colony of bats" with beheaded Mahavira statue outside. Now cleaned and restored, the Jain temple of Lakkundi is 
one of many historic Chalukya era Jain and Hindu temples found in Lakkundi. It is the oldest major Jain temple in this region.
