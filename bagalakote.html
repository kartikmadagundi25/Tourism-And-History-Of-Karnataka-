        Strategically situated on top of the hill, the fort encloses large granaries, a treasury impressive temples on
        top of the northern end of the hill. Malegitti Shivalaya, perhaps the oldest temple of the lot, is dedicated to 
        the benign aspect of Shiva as the garland maker. Placed on the summit of a rocky hill, the temple is built of 
        stone, finely joined without mortar, & with Dravidian tower. The lower Shivalaya has a Dravidian tower of which 
        only the sanctum remains now.

        Badami was the capital of the Chalukyas from 540 AD to 757 AD. The Badami Fort was the residence of the Chalukyan 
        rulers. The fort was plundered and destroyed by the Pallavas in 642 AD. Much later, when Badami came under the rule 
        of Tipu Sultan, the walls of the fort were rebuilt and several structures were added to the ancient fort complex.

        Location:
        Badami lies at a distance of about 509 km from Bangalore. Badami is a tourist destination and can be conveniently
         reached by various means of transport. Autos and horse-drawn carriages (tongas) can be hired to reach the base of
        the hill housing the Badami Fort from anywhere in Badami.

        The Galaganatha temple lies to the east of the Jambulingeshwara temple. Unlike the previous two temples, ASI
        estimates this temple to be from the mid-8th century, whereas Michell states that it is likely from late 7th 
        century. The temple is a northern rekha-nagara style with a linga, and a vestibule (antarala) within the temple 
        sanctum (garbha griha). Outside the temple is a seated Nandi that faces the sanctum.[29]The sanctum has a covered
        circumambulatory path (pradakshina patha), indicating that this Hindu tradition was well established by 7th to 8th 
        century. Various mandapas exist in this temple, such as a social or community hall (sabha mantapa), used for 
        ceremonial functions, and a mukha mantapa, of 
        Location:
        The Pattadakal monuments are located in the Indian state of Karnataka, about 165 kilometres (103 mi) southeast of 
        Belgaum, 265 kilometres (165 mi) northeast from Goa, 14 miles (23 km) from Badami, via Karnataka state highway SH14, 
        and about 6 miles (9.7 km) from Aihole, set midst sandstone mountains and Malaprabha river valley. In total, there 
        are over 150 Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist monuments, and archaeological discoveries, dating from the 4th to 10th century 
        CE, in addition to pre-historic dolmens and cave paintings that are preserved at the Pattadakal-Badami-Aihole site.
