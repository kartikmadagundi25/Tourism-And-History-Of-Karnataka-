        An incredibly breathtaking example of Indo - Saracenic style of architecture, the Mysore Palace is a magnificent edifice located 
        in Mysore in the state of Karnataka. Also known as the Amba Vilas Palace, it is the former palace of the royal family of Mysore 
        and is still their official residence. Mysore Palace was built in the year 1912 for the 24th Ruler of the Wodeyar Dynasty and is 
        counted amongst one of the biggest palaces in the country.
        Today, Mysore Palace is managed by the Government of Karnataka while it continues to retain its designation as the Royal Seat of 
        the Maharajas of Mysore. The grand edifice preserves various valuable possessions of Wodeyars which includes souvenirs, jewelery, 
        royal costumes, and paintings. Though the palace is open to the public, the erstwhile royal family still continues to live in a 
        portion of it. There is also a museum housed within the walled complex, called the Residential Museum, which incorporates some of these living quarters. No wonder, the palace counts among the top historical places to visit in Mysore.
